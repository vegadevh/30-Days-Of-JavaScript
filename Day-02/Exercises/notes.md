# Day 02 - NOTES

In JavaScript like in other languages we had some escape characters:

- \n: new line
- \t: Tab, means 8 spaces
- \\\\: Back slash
- \\\': Single quote (')
- \\\": Double quote (")

Examples:

1. Hello!\\n My name is Diego,\\n Nice to meet you. 

```

2. Todo list!\\n\tOrange Juice.\\n\tBread.

```
Todo list!
    Orange Juice.
    Bread.
```

3. This is a backslash symbol \\\\

4. "In every programming language it starts with \'Hello, World!\'"

```
"In every programming language it starts with 'Hello, World!'"
```

5. 'In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"'
